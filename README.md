# Tic Tac Toe with AI

Tic Tac Toe with AI is one of the projects in the Java Developer course on JetBrains Hyperskill platform.
Command line game gives you the opportunity to test yourself against the artifical intelligence on three different difficulty levels, play against a second player or watch two computer players play against each other.

- EASY MODE: AI makes completely random moves
- MEDIUM MODE: AI's initial moves are still random, but when it sees that it can win with one move, it will block you. Albo when it has an opportunity to win with one move - it will do it.
- HARD MODE: AI calculate all possible moves and look many moves ahead. It's impossible to beat it.


## How to start the game

To start the game, simply enter the appropriate command. 
Each time start by typing "start", then specify the first and second player (easy/medium/hard/user). Then type coordinates in the range 1 - 3. Exit the game just by typing "exit".
Remember that the order of entering players matters and the player who starts the game always has a X symbol.

Examples of commands:
```sh
Input command: start user easy
```

```sh
Input command: start medium user
```

```sh
Input command: start hard medium
```

```sh
Input command: start user user
```

```sh
Enter the coordinates: 2 2
```

```sh
Enter the coordinates: 1 3
```

```sh
Input command: exit
```
